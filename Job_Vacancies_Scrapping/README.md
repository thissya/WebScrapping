The Job Vacancy Scraper is a Python-based project designed to automate the process of extracting job listings from online job portals. Utilizing libraries such as requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas, the scraper fetches job details from specified URLs and consolidates this data into an Excel file. This tool is particularly useful for job seekers, HR professionals, and researchers looking to analyze job market trends.

The script retrieves job listings from provided URLs, extracting relevant details like company name, job role, skills required, location, posted date, and experience required.

Scraped data is appended to an Excel file, allowing for easy data management and analysis across multiple scraping sessions.
